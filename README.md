# Taco-Cloud
Implementation of Taco Cloud Spring app from Spring in Action 5th Edition. 

It's mostly the code from the book but it has some flavour added by me, which encouraged me to create this repository. Code in the book is also sometimes inconsistent or even doesn't work as expected so maybe this repository will help someone in progressing further. 

If a particular topic splits (eg. JDBC and JPA) there are separate branches for each solution.
